== MALAWI - next == 
- Allow up to 5 dimenision
    - Browse data not working (need to render 4 / 5 dimenions).
    - Check that collector works.
    
- Chart width - seems small. 

- Priority list - doesn't work with phillipines. 
- Reporting - extra text in reports. 

- Can we create enums Aliases - i. e. months grouped into Quaters.
- Can we only display enum values with data?
- Define default enum mappings (say month names to number).

- Create filters (enum types, single variables of entities)

= NEXT: 
- Report Title: Entity name in header and on graph (don't include in graph). 

= TODO =  
- Allow enum / date enum grouping. 
    - This can happen on collection level 
        - For dates, we need to be able to provide context with muliple values. 
        - For enums, we just need to provide context.
        - Define groupings in model (in enum definition)

- Allow flat selection (i. e. quater / month selection is only a month selection with names for each combination).
- How to join multiple month if showing data for the year. 
- Admin date editor, only allow strict hierarchy? 
    
- Group by only for dimensions of data
  - How to handle two fields (one with enum, the other not)
  - Only display if there is a possible group by. 
  - Remove field if changed. 

- Later: Validation picker and run validation against different hierarchy data. 
- Admin: Validation editor, second / third entry doesn't seem to commit 

== Maybe == 
- Date handling improvements (where can we specify date range - instead of fixed values)?

== Validation Release == 
- Sort in Validation UI. 

== Features ==
- Allow saving of Priority Lists meta result? 

== BUGS ==
- EmisToolboxAdmin - Better error message for query that does not exist. 
- EmisToolboxAdmin - Adding locations without dates. 'name' field doesn't have any date type. Maybe update later.
- data.bin seems to interfere when importing (old fields are not shown)

== Improvements ==
- Memory handling
    - clear cache by time.
    - clear entry before import.

- Data management
    - allow different data value stores

- Install scripts (use 64bit java if possible)

- Large dataset handling
    - Different data sources (sql, properties, partitioned memory set)
    - write logs straight to file (not in memory).
    
== GENERAL == 
- ByColumn with multiple access mappings doesn't work. 
- Default DB selection if only one. 
- Add titles / change buttons for classifications and hierarchy to make everything clearer. 
- Make field selection nicer in Indicator editor. 
- Excel reading / writing (allow new xlsx format).
- GIS configuration for background layers / images
- Improve error messages all round. 
- Add more help text in UI. 
- Add validation on leaving model
    - classification has values
    - we have a hierarchy
    - unused locations
    - date has values

- Improvements in backend UI
