= SQL training = 
(1) Prepare source database (MS-SQL)
- attach database
- ensure connection works
    - open IP port
    - provide login
- record the connection parameters

(2) Prepare target database 
- make backup of database before any migration
- maybe disable any further data inserts while running the migration
- ensure connection works
  - open IP port
  - provide login
- record the connection parameters

(3) Queries in database to find errors. 
  - important to be able to view source of errors / maybe see a pattern

(4) Queries to change error
  - but important to only change obvious things - don't interpret errors 

(5) Queries to explore data 
  - find for which years data has been submitted (group by Year).
